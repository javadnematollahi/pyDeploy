# Streamlit + Chatbot

I made a chatbot with streamlit with below features:

1. this chatbot has a database to keep users informations and messages
2. Every user can have an account with his own username and password. 
3. I connect this chatbot to an LLM and you can speak with that.

There is a link below that you can access to chatbot with it.
